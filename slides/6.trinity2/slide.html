It is now common to note that there has been a surprising revival of interest in
 the doctrine of the Trinity since the second half of the twentieth century...
 Recent writers have found in the Trinity not just the essence of Christian
 faith, but a seemingly endlessly generative doctrine for ethical and social
 ideas. Right belief about the Trinity will determine our understanding of the
 church, of the proper shape of human society, and of many other pastoral and
 political questions.  As Miroslav Volf put it in the title of a paper, ‘The
 Trinity is Our Social Program’

                    In our accounts of a Trinitarian revival, we wanted little
or nothing to do with such strictures. As a result, we set out on our own to
offer a different, and we believed better, doctrine. We returned to the
Scriptures, but we chose (with Tertullian’s Praxeas, Noetus of Smyrna,
and Samuel Clarke) to focus exclusively on the New Testament texts, instead of
listening to the whole of Scripture...  We thought about God’s relationship with
the creation in the economy, but we chose (with the
Valentinians, Arius, and Hegel) to believe that the Son must be the mode of
mediation of the Father’s presence to creation, instead of following Irenaeus
and Athanasius in proposing God’s ability to mediate his own presence. We
tried to understand the divine unity, but we chose (with Eunomius and Socinus) to believe that we could reason
adequately about the divine essence, instead of following Basil,
Gregory of Nyssa, Augustine, Thomas Aquinas, and John Calvin in
asserting divine unknowability. We addressed divine simplicity, and
chose (with Socinus and John Biddle) to discard it, rather than following Basil and the rest in affirming it as the heart of Trinitarian doctrine. We thought about Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, but chose (with
Sabellius, Arius, and Eunomius) to affirm true personality of each,
rather than following Augustine and John of Damascus in believing in
one divine personality.

thou hast given him power over all flesh, to give eternal life to all whom thou
hast given him. And this is eternal life, that they know thee the only true God,
and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent. I glorified thee on earth, having
accomplished the work which thou gavest me to do; and now, Father, glorify thou
me in thy own presence with the glory which I had with thee before the world was
made.
              <p>
              I have manifested thy name to the men whom thou gavest me out of
the world; thine they were, and thou gavest them to me, and they have kept thy
word. Now they know that everything that thou hast given me is from thee; for I
have given them the words which thou gavest me, and they have received them and
know in truth that I came from thee; and they have believed that thou didst send
me. I am praying for them; I am not praying for the world but for those whom
thou hast given me, for they are thine; all mine are thine, and thine are mine,

                and the world has hated them because they are not of the world, even as I am not
                of the world.  I do not pray that thou shouldst take them out of the world, but
                that thou shouldst keep them from the evil one. They are not of the world, even
                as I am not of the world. Sanctify them in the truth; thy word is truth. As thou
                didst send me into the world, so I have sent them into the world. And for their
                sake I consecrate myself, that they also may be consecrated in truth.
              </p>

              <p>
                I do not
                pray for these only, but also for those who believe in me through their word,
                that they may all be one; even as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that
                they also may be in us, so that the world may believe that thou hast sent
                me. The glory which thou hast given me I have given to them, that they may be
                one even as we are one, I in them and thou in me, that they may become perfectly
                one, so that the world may know that thou hast sent me and hast loved them even
                as thou hast loved me. Father, I desire that they also, whom thou hast given me,
                may be with me where I am, to behold my glory which thou hast given me in thy
                love for me before the foundation of the world. O righteous Father, the world
                has not known thee, but I have known thee; and these know that thou hast sent
                me. I made known to them thy name, and I will make it known, that the love with
                which thou hast loved me may be in them, and I in them.”

>Glory be to God for dappled things –
   For skies of couple-colour as a brinded cow;
      For rose-moles all in stipple upon trout that swim;
Fresh-firecoal chestnut-falls; finches’ wings;
   Landscape plotted and pieced – fold, fallow, and plough;
      And áll trádes, their gear and tackle and trim.

All things counter, original, spare, strange;
   Whatever is fickle, freckled (who knows how?)
      With swift, slow; sweet, sour; adazzle, dim;
He fathers-forth whose beauty is past change:
                                Praise him.
