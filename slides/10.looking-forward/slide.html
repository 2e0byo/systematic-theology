          <blockquote>
            Beginning is a problem not only for the thinking person, the
            philosopher, a problem that remains with him and determines all his
            subsequent steps; the beginning is also a primal decision which
            includes all later ones for the person whose life is based on
            response and decision.

            And finally: since religion in our modern period has renounced that
            word, it would not be idle to investigate at least this once what
            countenance (if we can still speak of a ‘countenance’) such a
            denuded religion may exhibit.

            Beauty is the word that shall be our first. Beauty is the last thing which
the thinking intellect dares to approach, since only it dances as an
uncontained splendour around the double constellation of the true and
the good and their inseparable relation to one another. Beauty is the
disinterested one, without which the ancient world refused to understand
itself, a word which both imperceptibly and yet unmistakably has bid
farewell to our new world, a world of interests, leaving it to its own
avarice and sadness. No longer loved or fostered by religion, beauty is
lifted from its face as a mask, and its absence exposes features on that
face which threaten to become incomprehensible to man. We no longer
dare to believe in beauty and we make of it a mere appearance in order
the more easily to dispose of it. Our situation today shows that beauty
demands for itself at least as much courage and decision as do truth and
goodness, and she will not allow herself to be separated and banned from
her two sisters without taking them along with herself in an act of
mysterious vengeance. We can be sure that whoever sneers at her name
as if she were the ornament of a bourgeois past—whether he admits it or
not—can no longer pray and soon will no longer be able to love. The
nineteenth century still held on with passionate frenzy to the fleeing
garments of beauty, which are the contours of the ancient world as it
dissolves: ‘Helena embraces Faust, her body vanishes, and only her robe
and veil remain in his arms. . . . Helena’s garments dissolve into clouds,
enveloping Faust. He is raised on high and floats away with the cloud’
(Faust, II, Act 3). The world, formerly penetrated by God’s light, now
becomes but an appearance and a dream—the Romantic vision—and
soon thereafter nothing but music. But where the cloud disperses, naked
matter remains as an indigestible symbol of fear and anguish. Since
nothing else remains, and yet something must be embraced, twentieth-
century man is urged to enter this impossible marriage with matter, a
union which finally spoils all man’s taste for love. But man cannot bear
to live with the object of his impotence, that which remains permanently
unmastered. He must either deny it or conceal it in the silence of death.

            In a world without beauty—even if people cannot dispense with the
word and constantly have it on the tip of their tongues in order to abuse
it—in a world which is perhaps not wholly without beauty, but which
can no longer see it or reckon with it: in such a world the good also loses
its attractiveness, the self-evidence of why it must be carried out. Man
stands before the good and asks himself why it must be done and not
rather its alternative, evil. For this, too, is a possibility, and even the
more exciting one: Why not investigate Satan’s depths? In a world that
no longer has enough confidence in itself to affirm the beautiful, the
proofs of the truth have lost their cogency. In other words, syllogisms
may still dutifully clatter away like rotary presses or computers which
infallibly spew out an exact number of answers by the minute. But the
logic of these answers is itself a mechanism which no longer captivates
anyone. The very conclusions are no longer conclusive. And if this is how
the transcendentals fare because one of them has been banished, what
will happen with Being itself? Thomas described Being (das Sein) as a
‘sure light’ for that which exists (das Seiende). Will this light not
necessarily die out where the very language of light has been forgotten
and the mystery of Being is no longer allowed to express itself? What
remains is then a mere lump of existence which, even if it claims for
itself the freedom proper to spirits, nevertheless remains totally dark and
incomprehensible even to itself. The witness borne by Being becomes
untrustworthy for the person who can no longer read the language of
beauty.
