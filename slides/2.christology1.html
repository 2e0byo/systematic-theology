                    things visible and invisible.  And in one Lord Jesus Christ
                    the Son of God, the only-begotten born of the Father, who is
                    of the substance of the Father, God from God, Light from
                    Light, True God from True God, Begotten <em>natum</em>, not

                    were made in heaven and on earth, who for our salvation came
                    down, was incarnate and made Man, suffered and rose the third
                    day and ascended into heaven, he will come to judge the living

                    "before he was born, he was not" and "who was made from
                    nothing" or from another substance or essence, or that the Son

              Fn:
              The canon pronounces his consecration invalid, and therefore equally
              invalid, any ordinations he may have performed. First Constantinople
              is too early for us to expect any clear distinction between what is
              invalid and what is valid but illicit: yet, the disorders of this
              miserable affair were so great that the Fathers of Constantinople,
              in view of the extremely rigid laws of the early Church in respect
              to jurisdiction, very probably did quite right in proclaiming
              Maximus’ orders invalid, and not merely wrongly gotten. Certainly
              the Church can make laws pertinent not only to the licit but also to
              the valid administration of the Sacraments. The Church today, for
              example, requires jurisdiction for a valid administration of the
              Sacrament of Penance. It is not too strong, I think, to say that the
              Church in the fourth century required jurisdiction for the valid

              (maximus ordained night egyptian bishops + sailors in Gregory's
              church; kicked out and finished in house of flute-player!)

                  both on sacred vessels and vestments, and on the walls and on
                  the altars, at home and on the streets, namely such images of
                  our Lord Jesus Christ, God and Savior, and of our undefiled
                  lady, or holy Mother of God, and of the honorable angels, and,
                  at the same time, of all the saints and of holy men. For, how
                  much more frequently through the imaginal formation they are
                  seen, so much more quickly are those who contemplate these,
                  raised to the memory and desire of the originals of these, to
                  kiss and to render honourable adoration to them, not however, to
                  grant true Latria ...  which is proper to divine nature alone;
                  but just as to the figure of the revered and life-giving Cross
                  and to the holy gospels let an oblation of incense and lights be
                  made to give honour....  "For the honour of the image passes to
                  the original"; and he who shows reverence to the image, shows
                  reverence to the substance of Him depicted in it.
