            <h2>Bibliography</h2>
            <div>
                <p>
                    For convenience the bibliography is available here. Do bear in mind
                    the comments in the first lecture about how to use a bibliography
                    effectively! Reading for each week will be posted via moodle and
                    emailed around.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Note that many of the Internet Archive links are short-term loans,
                    i.e. you can borrow them for an hour. This means only one person
                    can read the book at once! Thus if the book is unavailable you have
                    three options: 1. come back later, 2. search <a href="https://archive.org">archive.org</a> for
                    another copy,
                    3. bribe/threaten/cajole/persaude whoever is reading it to let you
                    have it. If you go for 3. there's a fair chance it's someone on
                    this course. Lastly there <em>appears</em> to be a workaround: if
                    you refresh the page, archive.org will load <em>only</em> the
                    current page of the book. This quickly grows tiresome, however.
                </p>

                This bibliography will expand as time goes on. Further reading for
                each lecture is suggested in a slide at the end of the presentation
                for that week.

            <h2>On reading:</h2>
            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    There is a strange idea abroad that in every subject the ancient books should be
                    read only by the professionals, and that the amateur should content himself with
                    the modern books. Thus I have found as a tutor in English Literature that if the
                    average student wants to find out something about Platonism, the very last thing
                    he thinks of doing is to take a translation of Plato off the library shelf and
                    read the Symposium. He would rather read some dreary modern book ten times as
                    long, all about “isms” and influences and only once in twelve pages telling him
                    what Plato actually said. [&#x2026;]
                </p>

                <p>
                    This mistaken preference for the modern books and this shyness of the old ones
                    is nowhere more rampant than in theology. Wherever you find a little study
                    circle of Christian laity you can be almost certain that they are studying not
                    St. Luke or St. Paul or St. Augustine or Thomas Aquinas or Hooker or Butler, but
                    M. Berdyaev or M. Maritain or M. Niebuhr or Miss Sayers or even myself. [&#x2026;]
                </p>

                <p>
                    It is a good rule, after reading a new book, never to allow yourself another new
                    one till you have read an old one in between. If that is too much for you, you
                    should at least read one old one to every three new ones.
                </p>
