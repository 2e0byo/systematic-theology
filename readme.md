# Materials for a Systematic Theology MA course in Edinburgh

This repository holds *some* of the materials for a systematic theology course I
am teaching in Edinburgh for St. Mary's University Twickenham.

It's on github for two reasons: 1. I actually know how to use github, and 2. I
can host my presentations here.

Needless to say, all these materials are copyright.  They are likely not very
interesting for you unless you happen to be on my course, in which case you
probably want [the website](https://2e0byo.github.io/systematic-theology) rather
than this repository, which holds the source code.

The presentations are written in reveal.js, and the index is a basic static webpage.
