            <aside class="notes">
              Sunday at Prime until recently (Pius X). Still said sometimes in the EF. (Trinity Sunday 62.)

                Whosoever will be saved, before all things it is necessary that
                he hold the catholic faith. Which faith unless every one do keep
                whole and undefiled, without doubt he shall perish
                everlastingly.
              </p>

              <p class="fragment">
                And the catholic faith is this:
                that we worship one God in Trinity, and Trinity in Unity; neither confounding
                the Persons, nor dividing the Essence. For there is one Person of the Father;
                another of the Son; and another of the Holy Ghost. But the Godhead of the
                Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, is all one; the Glory equal, the
                Majesty coeternal. Such as the Father is; such is the Son; and such is the Holy
                Ghost. The Father uncreated; the Son uncreated; and the Holy Ghost
                uncreated. The Father unlimited; the Son unlimited; and the Holy Ghost
                unlimited. The Father eternal; the Son eternal; and the Holy Ghost eternal. And
                yet they are not three eternals; but one eternal. As also there are not three
                uncreated; nor three infinites, but one uncreated; and one infinite. So likewise
                the Father is Almighty; the Son Almighty; and the Holy Ghost Almighty. And yet
                they are not three Almighties; but one Almighty. So the Father is God; the Son
                is God; and the Holy Ghost is God. And yet they are not three Gods; but one
                God. So likewise the Father is Lord; the Son Lord; and the Holy Ghost Lord. And
                yet not three Lords; but one Lord. For like as we are compelled by the Christian
                verity; to acknowledge every Person by himself to be God and Lord; So are we
                forbidden by the catholic religion; to say, There are three Gods, or three
                Lords. The Father is made of none; neither created, nor begotten. The Son is of
                the Father alone; not made, nor created; but begotten. The Holy Ghost is of the
                Father and of the Son; neither made, nor created, nor begotten; but
                proceeding.</p>

                So there is one Father, not three Fathers; one Son, not three Sons;
                one Holy Ghost, not three Holy Ghosts. And in this Trinity none is before, or
                after another; none is greater, or less than another. But the whole three
                Persons are coeternal, and coequal. So that in all things, as aforesaid; the
                Unity in Trinity, and the Trinity in Unity, is to be worshipped. He therefore
                that will be saved, let him thus think of the Trinity.

                    Whether the trinitarian views of East and West were genuinely incompatible is almost
                    secondary to the fact that beginning in the eighth or ninth century people began to
                    think that they were. This was especially true in the East, where the link between
                    orthodoxy and orthopraxis was much stronger, and the West’s use of an interpolated
                    creed signaled to many a substantively different faith. From the Latins’
                    perspective, the Eastern rejection of the filioque was considered not only sinful
                    disobedience to Peter’s legitimate successor, but also a denial of the
                    consubstantiality of the Father and Son, and thus a form of crypto-Arianism.
                  </p>

                  <p class="fragment">
                    by the ninth century the
                    Greeks’ knowledge of the Western fathers
                    (and the Latins’ knowledge of the East) was,
                    on the whole, rather poor. For this reason
                    the West relied quite heavily on the Latin
                    fathers (especially Augustine) while the
                    Byzantines depended almost solely on
                    Greek-speaking authors. By the fifteenth
                    century the Greek delegates at Florence were
                    (on several occasions) forced to admit a
                    total ignorance of the Latin patristic
                    tradition. And although the Latins and their
                    unionist supporters in the East increasingly
                    used Greek sources to prove their case, to
                    claim that they utilized the Greek fathers
                    is not to say that they understood them.

                    The issue of ecumenicity was compounded by the
                    problem of translation. As the centuries passed, fewer participants in the
                    debate were bilingual, so Greeks and Latins alike were forced to rely on works
                    received in translation. This process frequently fostered misunderstanding [...]
                    This was particularly true of the Greek word
                    ἐκπορεύεσθαι (“to proceed”), which was used
                    in the Scripture (Jn 15:26) and the Nicene-Constantinopolitan Creed to
                    describe the procession of the Holy Spirit. In the West this word was translated by
                    the Latin verb, procedere [...]
                  </p>

                  <p class="fragment">
                    Yet the methodological question that was the most perplexing was the hermeneutical
                    one: should the Greek fathers, who
                    wrote ambiguously of the Spirit’s procession διὰ τοῦ Υἱοῦ, be interpreted in light
                    of the Western fathers (who had
                    spoken more explicitly about procession ex filio), or should the Latin patristic
                    witness be read through the Greek lens,
                    since their testimony was the more ancient?

            >One day, God walked in, pale from the grey steppe,
slit-eyed against the wind, and stopped,
said, Colour me, breathe your blood into my mouth.

I said, Here is the blood of all our people,
these are their bruises, blue and purple,
gold, brown, and pale green wash of death.

These (god) are the chromatic pains of flesh,
I said, I trust I shall make you blush,
O I shall stain you with the scars of birth

For ever, I shall root you in the wood,
under the sun shall bake you bread
of beechmast, never let you forth

To the white desert, to the starving sand.
But we shall sit and speak around
one table, share one food, one earth.
