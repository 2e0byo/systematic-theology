                    things visible and invisible.  And in one Lord Jesus Christ
                    the Son of God, the only-begotten born of the Father, who is
                    of the substance of the Father, God from God, Light from
                    Light, True God from True God, Begotten <em>natum</em>, not
                    Made, consubstantial with the father, through whom all things
                    were made in heaven and on earth, who for our salvation came
                    down, was incarnate and made Man, suffered and rose the third
                    day and ascended into heaven, he will come to judge the living
                    and the dead.  And [we believe] in the Holy Ghost.

                  <p>
                    But those who say "He was; and at one time he was not", and
                    "before he was born, he was not" and "who was made from
                    nothing" or from another substance or essence, or that the Son
                    of God is changeable or mutable---these the Catholic Church
                    anathematises.

              ordained by him is is not ordained at all, since all things
              undertaken in his behalf and by him are invalid.

              Fn:
              The canon pronounces his consecration invalid, and therefore equally
              invalid, any ordinations he may have performed. First Constantinople
              is too early for us to expect any clear distinction between what is
              invalid and what is valid but illicit: yet, the disorders of this
              miserable affair were so great that the Fathers of Constantinople,
              in view of the extremely rigid laws of the early Church in respect
              to jurisdiction, very probably did quite right in proclaiming
              Maximus’ orders invalid, and not merely wrongly gotten. Certainly
              the Church can make laws pertinent not only to the licit but also to
              the valid administration of the Sacraments. The Church today, for
              example, requires jurisdiction for a valid administration of the
              Sacrament of Penance. It is not too strong, I think, to say that the
              Church in the fourth century required jurisdiction for the valid

              (maximus ordained night egyptian bishops + sailors in Gregory's
              church; kicked out and finished in house of flute-player!)

                  We...  define... that the venerable and holy
                  images ... must be suitably placed in the holy churches of God,
                  both on sacred vessels and vestments, and on the walls and on
                  the altars, at home and on the streets, namely such images of
                  our Lord Jesus Christ, God and Savior, and of our undefiled
                  lady, or holy Mother of God, and of the honorable angels, and,
                  at the same time, of all the saints and of holy men. For, how
                  much more frequently through the imaginal formation they are
                  seen, so much more quickly are those who contemplate these,
                  raised to the memory and desire of the originals of these, to
                  kiss and to render honourable adoration to them, not however, to
                  grant true Latria ...  which is proper to divine nature alone;
                  but just as to the figure of the revered and life-giving Cross
                  and to the holy gospels let an oblation of incense and lights be
                  made to give honour....  "For the honour of the image passes to
                  the original"; and he who shows reverence to the image, shows
                  reverence to the substance of Him depicted in it.

                >Intende, qui regis Israel
super Cherubim qui sedes,
appare Ephraem coram, excita
potentiam tuam et veni.

Veni, redemptor gentium,
Ostende partum Virginis,
Miretur omne saeculum:
Talis decet partus Deum.

Non ex virili semine,
Sed mystico spiramine,
Verbum Dei factum caro,
Fructusque ventris floruit.

Alvus tumescit Virginis,
Claustrum pudoris permanet,
Vexilla virtutum micant,
Versatur in templo Deus.

Procedens de thalamo suo,
Pudoris aula regia,
Geminae Gigas substantiae,
Alacris ut currat viam.

Egressus ejus a Patre,
Regressus ejus ad Patrem;
Excursus usque ad inferos,
Recursus ad sedem Dei.

Aequalis aeterno Patri
Carnis tropaeo accingere
Infirma nostri corporis
Virtute firmans perpeti.

Praesepe jam fulget tuum,
Lumenque nox spirat novum,
Quod nulla nox interpolet,
Fideque jugi luceat.

            ### Summary so far
            - Christ is Very God
              - Trinity!
              - Is a divine person [n.b. not *being*]
              - Divine Will
              - Divine Nature
            - Christ is Very Man
              - Human Will
              - Human Nature
              - Manhood taken up into Godhood, not Godhood reduced to Manhood

            NOTES:
            - *This all changes something*—but we are too close!
            - this something is not (only) theoretical

          <h3>All this bickering</h3>
          <blockquote>
            Why shouldn't we quarrel about a word? What is the good of words if
            they aren't important enough to quarrel over? Why do we choose one
            word more than another if there isn't any difference between them?
            If you called a woman a chimpanzee instead of an angel, wouldn't
            there be a quarrel about a word? If you're not going to argue about
            words, what are you going to argue about? Are you going to convey
            your meaning to me by moving your ears ? The Church and the heresies
            always used to fight about words, because they are the only things
            worth fighting about.
