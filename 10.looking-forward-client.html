                Beginning is a problem not only for the thinking person, the
                philosopher, a problem that remains with him and determines all his
                subsequent steps; the beginning is also a primal decision which
                includes all later ones for the person whose life is based on
                response and decision...

                  ...whoever, I say, confronts <em>such</em> wholeness of truth

                  to take back, one which he will not afterwards have to correct
                  with violence, but one which is broad enough to foster and
                  include all words to follow, and clear enough to penetrate all
                  the others with its light.

            since religion in our modern period has renounced that word, it
            would not be idle to investigate at least this once what countenance (if we can still speak of a ‘countenance’) such a
            denuded religion may exhibit.

                Beauty is the word that shall be our first.</span><span class="fragment"> Beauty is the last thing
              which the thinking intellect dares to approach, since only it
              dances as an uncontained splendour around the double constellation
              of the true and the good and their inseparable relation to one
              another. Beauty is the disinterested one, without which the
              ancient world refused to understand itself, a word which both
              imperceptibly and yet unmistakably has bid farewell to our new
              world, a world of interests, leaving it to its own avarice and
              sadness. No longer loved or fostered by religion, beauty is lifted
              from its face as a mask, and its absence exposes features on that
              face which threaten to become incomprehensible to man. We no
              longer dare to believe in beauty and we make of it a mere
              appearance in order the more easily to dispose of it.
                </span>

            <p class="fragment">
                Our situation today shows that beauty demands for itself at
              least as much courage and decision as do truth and goodness, and
              she will not allow herself to be separated and banned from her two
              sisters without taking them along with herself in an act of
              mysterious vengeance. We can be sure that whoever sneers at her
              name as if she were the ornament of a bourgeois past—whether he
              admits it or not—can no longer pray and soon will no longer be
              able to love. The nineteenth century still held on with passionate
              frenzy to the fleeing garments of beauty, which are the contours
              of the ancient world as it dissolves: ‘Helena embraces Faust, her
              body vanishes, and only her robe and veil remain in his
              arms. . . . Helena’s garments dissolve into clouds, enveloping
              Faust. He is raised on high and floats away with the cloud’
(Faust, II, Act 3).

              The world, formerly penetrated by God’s light, now becomes but an
              appearance and a dream—the Romantic vision—and soon thereafter
              nothing but music. But where the cloud disperses, naked matter
              remains as an indigestible symbol of fear and anguish. Since
              nothing else remains, and yet something must be embraced,
              twentieth- century man is urged to enter this impossible marriage
              with matter, a union which finally spoils all man’s taste for
              love. But man cannot bear to live with the object of his
              impotence, that which remains permanently unmastered. He must
              either deny it or conceal it in the silence of death.

            In a world without beauty—even if people cannot dispense with the
word and constantly have it on the tip of their tongues in order to abuse it—in
a world which is perhaps not wholly without beauty, but which can no longer see
it or reckon with it: in such a world the good also loses its attractiveness,
the self-evidence of why it must be carried out. Man stands before the good and
asks himself why it must be done and not rather its alternative, evil.  For
this, too, is a possibility, and even the more exciting one: Why not investigate
Satan’s depths?

>Haile! sterne superne. Haile! in eterne,
In Godis sicht to shine.
Lucerne in derne for to discerne
Be glory and grace divine.
Hodiern, modern, sempitern,
Angelicall regine,
Our tern inferne for to dispern,
Helpe! rialest rosine.
Ave! Maria, gracia plena,
Haile! freshe floure feminine,
Yerne us, guberne, virgin matern,
Of reuth baith rute and rine.

Emprice of pris, imperatrice,
Bricht, polist, precious stane,
Victrice of vice, hie genetrice
Of Jesu, Lord soveraine,
Our wis pavis fra enemis
Agane the Feindis traine,
Oratrice, mediatrice, salvatrice,
To God gret suffragane.
Ave! Maria, gracia plena,
Haile! sterne meridiane,
Spice, flowr delice of paradise,
That baire the glorius graine.

Imperiall wall, place palestrall
Of peirless pulcritude,
Triumphale hall, hie trone regall
Of Godis celsitude,
Hospitall riall, the Lord of all
Thy closet did include,
Bricht ball crystall, ros virginall,
Fulfillit of angel fude,
Ave! Maria, gracia plena,
Thy birth has, with his blude,
Fra fall mortall, originall,
Us raunsound on the Rude.
